      <h1>AItomotives - Vehicle AI</h1>

        <h1>Project Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
          The team is to research development into an autonomous vehicle that is
          controlled by artificial intelligence in order to perform certain tasks.
          The team will be able to give the drone a few waypoints to hit, where
          each waypoint carries a certain type of reward. The drone will then
          determine the best path to take to receive these rewards.
          Then, while on this path, the drone will get hit with some sort of
          variability. The drone should make predictions about what it
          experiences and be able to be able to react to these scenarios is
          logical ways. Ie: If the drone will run out of energy, should it
          return to base instead of continuing the flight? This development and
          research will be done using simulations, and may eventually reach the
          point of using hardware as a stretch goal.

          We will be having asynchrounous daily standups, with a focus on the
          work completed and current blockers. We will be utilizing a Kanban
          board that the team will keep groomed and prioritized. This is will
          also serve as the main focus for issue tracking.
