        <h1>Project Synopsis</h1>
        <p>
          The central conceit of this project was to develop a system to allow for dynamic and autonomous path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The team was expected to do this using a pre-designed evolutionary Recurrent Neural Network (eRNN), called Evolutionary Exploration of Augmenting Convolutional Topologies, or EXACT for short. The specifics of how said system worked were not important for the team to understand, merely how to interface with it so predictions could be generated for path planning. Several pieces of off-shelf-software were required, namely Ardupilot, a drone simulation software, ROS, a system designed for running code on drones, and Mission Planner, a kind of virtualized control station for drones. In essence, the team's primary job was to generate the connective code to get these four components working together to facilitate a system for drones to be able to pick their own paths given a list of waypoints to travel to.
